This repository contains lists of world countries in JSON, CSV and XML. Each line contains:

 - the country name

 - the country top-level domain (tld)

 - the country code ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (cca2)

 - the country code ISO 3166-1 numeric (ccn3)

 - the country code ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (cca3)
 
 - the country currency code(s) (comma separated if several)

 - the country calling code(s) (comma separated if several)

 - the country alternative spellings (comma separated if several)

 - the country relevance

 - the country region

 - the country subregion (comma separated if several)
 
# 
Alternative spellings and relevance are inspired by https://github.com/JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete. 

Region and subregion are taken from https://github.com/hexorx/countries.

I used http://www.shancarter.com/data_converter/index.html to generate the JSON and XML; the CSV was done by hand.
