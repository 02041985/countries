This repository contains lists of world countries in JSON, CSV and XML. Each line contains:

 - the country name

 - the country top-level domain

 - the country code ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (cca2

 - the country code ISO 3166-1 numeric (ccn3)

 - the country code ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (cca3)
 
 - alternative spellings of the country name
 
 - the country relevance
 
 The last two columns are inspired by https://github.com/JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete. I removed a few spellings because of some unicode issues. If someone has a fix, please send a pull request.
